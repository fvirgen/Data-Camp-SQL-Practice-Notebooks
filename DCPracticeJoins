## Combine the states and countries tables into one table.
The final result should have a name column, a continent column, and an indep_year column. Use the local_name column from the countries table as the name.
The final result should not include duplicate rows. ##

SELECT name, continent, indep_year
FROM world.countries
UNION 
SELECT name, continent, indep_year
FROM world.states

## Return the country_code, fertility_rate, and life_expectancy from the populations table.
Only return countries which are categorized as 'large' in the countries_plus table.
Filter for data from 2015. ##

SELECT country_code, fertility_rate, life_expectancy
FROM world.populations
WHERE year = 2015 AND
country_code IN 
(SELECT code
FROM world.countries_plus
WHERE geosize_group = 'large'
AND populations.country_code = countries_plus.code)

## Return the local_name aliased as country_name, continent, surface_area, the number of official languages, gdp_percapita, and unemployment_rate from the countries, economies, and languages tables.
Ensure that all records from the countries table are preserved, regardless whether a match is present in the economies or languages tables.
Only include economy data from 2015.
Sort your results by gdp_percapita in descending order. ##

SELECT c.local_name AS country_name, c.continent, c.surface_area, e.gdp_percapita, e.unemployment_rate,
(SELECT count(*)
FROM world.languages
WHERE official = 'True' AND c.code = languages.code
GROUP BY code) AS num_off_langs
FROM world.countries AS c
LEFT JOIN world.economies AS e
USING (code)
WHERE year = 2015
